# IllnessClassification
Depression and schizophrenia are prevalent mental health disorders that affect millions of people worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that depression is a leading cause of disability globally, with an estimated 264 million people affected in 2020. Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental disorder that affects approximately 20 million people worldwide. According to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the COVID-19 pandemic led to increased levels of anxiety, depression, and stress in many individuals. A study published in The Lancet Psychiatry also found that COVID-19 lockdowns were associated with increased rates of depression and anxiety in some countries. Accurate and timely diagnosis of these disorders is crucial for effective treatment and management. However, traditional diagnostic methods can be challenging and may not always be sufficient.  

Recent studies suggest that individuals with behavioural disorders such as depression and schizophrenia exhibit lower levels of mobility compared to healthy individuals. To address this issue, this thesis focuses on the classification of mental illness using motor activity data collected from wrist sensors worn by depressive and schizophrenic patients, as well as healthy patients. The study utilized public datasets containing activity readings recorded every minute over a period of approximately two weeks.  

Machine learning algorithms were employed to analyse the data and assess classification accuracy. The best model was Radom Forest Classifier (RFC), which recorded 74% accuracy for multiclass classification. Results indicate that motor activity data can be a useful tool in classifying mental illness and have implications for the development of non-invasive diagnostic tools for mental health disorders. The findings of this thesis suggest that motor activity data may provide useful insights into the mobility patterns of individuals with behavioural disorders and could be used as a diagnostic tool to aid in the identification of depression and schizophrenia.
